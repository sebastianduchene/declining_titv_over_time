# Declining transition/transversion ratios through time reveal limitations to the accuracy of nucleotide substitution models

This repository contains the data sets and R code to reproduce the results in shown in the study, currently in press for BMC Evolutionary Biology. Please cite as:

The files are described below:

- The sequence data used for the detailed analyes are available as fasta alignments in [data_sets_detailed](https://github.com/sebastianduchene/declining_titv_over_time/tree/master/data_sets_detailed).

- The accession numbers for the broad-scale analyses are available in [ACCNS.xlsx](https://github.com/sebastianduchene/declining_titv_over_time/blob/master/ACCNS.xlsx).

- The code to simulate the behaviour of the gamma distribution of among-site rate heterogeity is available in [gamma_rates.R](https://github.com/sebastianduchene/declining_titv_over_time/blob/master/gamma_rates.R). This code can be run in R to reproduce Figure 2 in the paper.
